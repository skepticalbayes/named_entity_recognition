Heuristic NER; and contextually smart NER implementations in tensrflow  

This repo uses the encoder implemented in transfer learning repo.

We first identify the tokens in text using Heuristic NER logic then club the token and the sentence and predict if the 
heursitically identified phrase and sentence are contextually correctly identified using our NER model.
